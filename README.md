Data Cleaning , Sorting , Visualizations and insights using excel
 I was given a General ledger and asked to find duplicate payments. The General ledger had no tabular structure and I had to unmerge the cells in Excel and put in tabular format.
 I Converted the columns to their correct data type and the used python and excel to get the duplicates.
 Two files ** Copy of data** are general ledger files and the duplicates Sheets are the final results
